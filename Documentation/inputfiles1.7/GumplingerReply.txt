Hi Naomi,

Please, see example:

examples/extended/field/field04

in the G4 distribution. I admit, this is rather involved - it comes from Tom Roberts and Muons 
Inc. and G4BEAMLINE.

The big problem with Geant4 is that you can't overlap physical volumes. In G3, I did just that, 
assign fields to logical volumes then positioned them so they overlapped. The FieldManager knew 
to loop through all overlapping logical-volumes and added the fields. In G4 this is not allowed. 
However, one approach that I have not tried is use 'parallel worlds' where you define a bounding 
field volume in one world and the overlapping one in the other (parallel) world. One should be 
able to make this work ... and it is something on my to-do-list to find out, how exactly one 
would go about it.

In the meantime, I suggest you take the relevant code from field04.

Infrastructure classes: ElementField, GlobalField

and specific implementation (if you want):

SimpleSolenoid and/or FocusSolenoid

or you write your own.

Cheers, Peter
